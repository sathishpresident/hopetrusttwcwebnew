But our good planning ensured that the event was asuccess.\n From Thuriayur we managed to catch one of the only 4 buses plying to Top Sengatupatti.

We briefed the Principal about our plan for the day.\n As already planned we split ourselves into 3 teams of 5 members each and started engaging the students. Simultaneous sessions were conducted. While fun games and activities were being organized for students of class 10, career guidance were being organized for the students of class 11.\n A discussion on the latest technological innovations was being held with the students of class 12. In the meantime, another team handed over a projector the school management had asked us during the pre visit for teaching students practical concepts that involved more visualization. After each team completed their respective task, they moved on to the next class.\n Thus this way we ensured all 3 classes-10th, 11th, and 12th were part of all 3 sessions namely games and activities, career guidance and technological innovation discussion.\n The teammembers shared their experiences and gave valuableadvice to the students.\nOnce this session came to a close we disturbed a feedback form to the students.\n The results revealed they thoroughly enjoyed all 3 sessions and the career guidance session in particular was a standout. During the discussions \n we made sure students participated actively in various events and we awarded them gifts for the same in the form of Thirukurral books and dictionaries. Additionally, we fitted wall clocks we had bought for the classes during the course of the sessions.\n The school management were impressed by our effective time management skills and also thanked us for the valuable contributions we made towards the school.\n With this, event-13 came to an end.',
